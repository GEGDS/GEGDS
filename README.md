  <strong>Oi eu sou GEGDS üëãüèΩ</strong>

  I'm currently studying node.js | express | ejs


  Passionate about technology, 
  but I only had contact with a computer
  when I was 16.
  I always wanted to study in the area,
  but I only had the means after I was 24.

  I love learning and focus on new things 
  until I get good at them. 
  Sometimes, depending on the subject, 
  I am a slow learner or a fast learner.

  I like to implement new things 
  that I learn to find a better way 
  to code.

  <h3>More about me</h3>
  - I like to code while listening to rain songs,
  which feels strange when the weather is very hot

  - I love manga. My current big three are 
  Fullmetal Alchemist, One Piece, and Jujutsu Kaisen, 
  with an honorable mention to Blue Lock

  - My first encounter with programming was when 
  I played the game Mugen, which featured characters from 
  various universes. To add a character to the game,
  you needed to copy and paste the character's 
  code into the right place in the game files.

  - One of my main interests in programming is 
  the opportunity for continued studies. At first, 
  I was very happy with it, but then I felt a little overwhelmed
  by the huge amount of subjects there are to study,
  which seems a bit contradictory
